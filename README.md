# Clustering on Real World Datasets

Usually we observe clustering on computer generated datasets. But it has to be noted that when clustering is applied on Real-world datasets the results do not come close to what you expect. Regarless, this Project aims at applying popular clustering algorithms on Real World Datasets.


## Clustering Algorithms used:

<ol>
  <li>K-means</li>
  <li>GMM</li>
  <li>Hierarchical</li>
</ol>

## Determining number of clusters

Over time there were many criteria proposed for determining number of clusters. I think there are nealy 5 times more number of methods for determining number of clusters than the number of clustering algorithms. I have used the following methods for determining number of clusters: 

<ol>
  <li>Elbow</li>
  <li>GAP statistic</li>
  <li>Silhouette</li>
  <li>Calinski-Harabaz index</li>
</ol>

### Note:

I will be adding more algorithms and criteria/method in future commits
